# Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling group should cover multiple Availability Zones

| Provider            | Category  |

## Description

This control checks whether an Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling group spans at least the specified number of Availability Zones (AZs). The control fails if an Auto Scaling group doesn't span at least the specified number of AZs. Unless you provide a custom parameter value for the minimum number of AZs, Security Hub uses a default value of two AZs.

An Auto Scaling group that doesn't span multiple AZs can't launch instances in another AZ to compensate if the configured single AZ becomes unavailable. However, an Auto Scaling group with a single Availability Zone may be preferred in some use cases, such as batch jobs or when inter-AZ transfer costs need to be kept to a minimum. In such cases, you can disable this control or suppress its findings.

This rule is covered by the [autoscaling-group-should-cover-multiple-azs](https://github.com/hashicorp/policy-library-NIST-Policy-Set-for-AWS-Terraform/blob/main/policies/autoscalinggroup/autoscaling-group-should-cover-multiple-azs.sentinel) policy.
