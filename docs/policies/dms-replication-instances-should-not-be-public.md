## Description

This control checks whether AWS DMS replication instances are public. To do this, it examines the value of the PubliclyAccessible field.

A private replication instance has a private IP address that you cannot access outside of the replication network. A replication instance should have a private IP address when the source and target databases are in the same network. The network must also be connected to the replication instance's VPC using a VPN, AWS Direct Connect, or VPC peering.

This rule is covered by the [dms-replication-instances-should-not-be-public](https://github.com/hashicorp/policy-library-NIST-Policy-Set-for-AWS-Terraform/blob/main/policies/dms/dms-replication-instances-should-not-be-public.sentinel) policy.
