# AWS RDS instance should have monitoring configured

| Provider            | Category   |
|---------------------|------------|
| Amazon Web Services | Monitoring |

## Description

This control checks whether enhanced monitoring is enabled for an Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) DB instance. 
The control fails if enhanced monitoring isn't enabled for the instance. 
If you provide a custom value for the monitoringInterval parameter, the control passes only if enhanced monitoring metrics are collected for the instance at the specified interval.

This rule is covered by the [rds-ensure-monitoring-configured](https://github.com/hashicorp/policy-library-NIST-Policy-Set-for-AWS-Terraform/blob/main/policies/rds/rds-ensure-monitoring-configured.sentinel) policy.
