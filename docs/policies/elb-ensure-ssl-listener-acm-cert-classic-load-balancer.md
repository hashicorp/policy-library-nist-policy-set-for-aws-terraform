# Classic Load Balancers with SSL/HTTPS listeners should use a certificate provided by AWS Certificate Manager

| Provider            | Category     |
|---------------------|--------------|
| Amazon Web Services | Networking   |

## Description

This policy checks whether the Classic Load Balancer uses HTTPS/SSL certificates provided by AWS Certificate Manager (ACM). The policy fails if the Classic Load Balancer configured with HTTPS/SSL listener does not use a certificate provided by ACM.

To create a certificate, you can use either ACM or a tool that supports the SSL and TLS protocols, such as OpenSSL. Security Hub recommends that you use ACM to create or import certificates for your load balancer.

ACM integrates with Classic Load Balancers so that you can deploy the certificate on your load balancer. You also should automatically renew these certificates.

This rule is covered by the [elb-ensure-ssl-listener-acm-cert-classic-load-balancer](https://github.com/hashicorp/policy-library-NIST-Policy-Set-for-AWS-Terraform/blob/main/policies/elb/elb-ensure-ssl-listener-acm-cert-classic-load-balancer.sentinel) policy.

      Pass - elb-ensure-ssl-listener-acm-cert-classic-load-balancer.sentinel

      Description:
        This policy checks if resources of type 'aws_elb' have
        HTTPS/SSL listeners configured with certs from acm.

      Print messages:

      This result means that all resources have passed the policy check for the policy elb-ensure-ssl-listener-acm-cert-classic-load-balancer.
