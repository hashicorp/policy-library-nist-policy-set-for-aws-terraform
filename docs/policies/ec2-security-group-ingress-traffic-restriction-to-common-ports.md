# AWS Security Group should not allow ingress traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 or ::/0 to common ports

## Description

DISCLAIMER - This policy works when all resources of type aws_security_group, aws_security_group_rule and aws_vpc_security_group_ingress_rule 
have their `cidr_blocks`,`ipv6_cidr_blocks`,`cidr_ipv4` or `cidr_ipv6`  attributes set as a constant value.

This control checks whether unrestricted incoming traffic for an Amazon EC2 security group is accessible to the specified ports that are considered to be high risk. This control fails if any of the rules in a security group allow ingress traffic from '0.0.0.0/0' or '::/0' to those ports.

Security groups provide stateful filtering of ingress and egress network traffic to AWS resources. Unrestricted access (0.0.0.0/0) increases opportunities for malicious activity, such as hacking, denial-of-service attacks, and loss of data.

This rule is covered by the [ec2-security-group-ingress-traffic-restriction-to-common-ports](https://github.com/hashicorp/policy-library-NIST-Policy-Set-for-AWS-Terraform/blob/main/policies/ec2/ec2-security-group-ingress-traffic-restriction-to-common-ports.sentinel) policy when the `port` parameter is passed as `22`.
