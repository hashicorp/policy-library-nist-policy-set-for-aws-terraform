# CloudFront distributions should encrypt traffic to custom origins

## Description

This control checks if Amazon CloudFront distributions are encrypting traffic to custom origins. This control fails for a CloudFront distribution whose origin protocol policy allows 'http-only'. This control also fails if the distribution's origin protocol policy is 'match-viewer' while the viewer protocol policy is 'allow-all'.

HTTPS (TLS) can be used to help prevent eavesdropping or manipulation of network traffic. Only encrypted connections over HTTPS (TLS) should be allowed.

This rule is covered by the [cloudfront-distributions-should-encrypt-traffic-to-custom-origins](https://github.com/hashicorp/policy-library-NIST-Policy-Set-for-AWS-Terraform/blob/main/policies/cloudfront/cloudfront-distributions-should-encrypt-traffic-to-custom-origins.sentinel) policy.
