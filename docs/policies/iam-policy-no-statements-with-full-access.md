# IAM customer managed policies that you create should not allow wildcard actions for services

## Description

This control checks whether the IAM identity-based policies that you create have Allow statements that use the * wildcard to grant permissions for all actions on any service. The control fails if any policy statement includes "Effect": "Allow" with "Action": "Service:*".

The control also fails if you use "Effect": "Allow" with "NotAction": "service:*". In that case, the NotAction element provides access to all of the actions in an AWS service, except for the actions specified in NotAction.

This rule is covered by the [iam-policy-no-statements-with-full-access](https://github.com/hashicorp/policy-library-NIST-Policy-Set-for-AWS-Terraform/blob/main/policies/iam/iam-policy-no-statements-with-full-access.sentinel) policy.
