## Description

This control checks whether a Neptune DB cluster snapshot is encrypted at rest. The control fails if a Neptune DB cluster isn't encrypted at rest.

This rule is covered by the [neptune-cluster-snapshot-encryption-at-rest-enabled](https://github.com/hashicorp/policy-library-NIST-Policy-Set-for-AWS-Terraform/blob/main/policies/neptune/neptune-cluster-snapshot-encryption-at-rest-enabled.sentinel) policy.

## Policy Results (Pass)
```bash
trace:
    Pass - neptune-cluster-snapshot-encryption-at-rest-enabled.sentinel

    Description:
    This policy requires attribute 'snapshot_identifier' to be set and 'storage_encrypted' to be set to true for 'aws_neptune_cluster' resources

    Print messages:

    → → Overall Result: true

    This result means that all resources have passed the policy check for the policy neptune-cluster-snapshot-encryption-at-rest-enabled.

    ✓ Found 0 resource violations
