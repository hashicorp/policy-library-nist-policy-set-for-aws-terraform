## Description

This control checks whether root access is turned on for an Amazon SageMaker notebook instance. The control fails if root access is turned on for a SageMaker notebook instance.

In adherence to the principal of least privilege, it is a recommended security best practice to restrict root access to instance resources to avoid unintentionally over provisioning permissions.

This rule is covered by the [sagemaker-notebook-instance-root-access-check](https://github.com/hashicorp/policy-library-NIST-Policy-Set-for-AWS-Terraform/blob/main/policies/sagemaker/sagemaker-notebook-instance-root-access-check.sentinel) policy.
