# API Gateway REST API stages should have AWS X-Ray tracing enabled

| Provider            | Category           |

## Description

This control checks whether AWS X-Ray active tracing is enabled for your Amazon API Gateway REST API stages.

X-Ray active tracing enables a more rapid response to performance changes in the underlying infrastructure. Changes in performance could result in a lack of availability of the API. X-Ray active tracing provides real-time metrics of user requests that flow through your API Gateway REST API operations and connected services.

This rule is covered by the [api-gateway-rest-have-x-ray-tracing-enabled](https://github.com/hashicorp/policy-library-NIST-Policy-Set-for-AWS-Terraform/blob/main/policies/apigateway/api-gateway-rest-have-x-ray-tracing-enabled.sentinel) policy.
