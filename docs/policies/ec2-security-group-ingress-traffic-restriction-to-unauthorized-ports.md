## Description

DISCLAIMER - This policy works when all resources of type aws_security_group, aws_security_group_rule and the attribute `service_name` attribute is used to define the service.

This control checks whether an Amazon EC2 security group permits unrestricted incoming traffic from unauthorized ports. The control status is determined as follows:

- If you use the default value for authorizedTcpPorts, the control fails if the security group permits unrestricted incoming traffic from any port other than ports 80 and 443.

- If you provide custom parameter values for authorized_tcp_ports or authorized_udp_ports in the [sentinel.hcl](https://github.com/hashicorp/policy-library-NIST-Policy-Set-for-AWS-Terraform/blob/main/sentinel.hcl) file for the policy, the control fails if the security group permits unrestricted incoming traffic from any unlisted port.

This rule is covered by the [ec2-security-group-ingress-traffic-restriction-to-unauthorized-ports](https://github.com/hashicorp/policy-library-NIST-Policy-Set-for-AWS-Terraform/blob/main/policies/ec2/ec2-security-group-ingress-traffic-restriction-to-unauthorized-ports.sentinel) policy.
