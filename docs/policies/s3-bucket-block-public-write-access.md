## Description

This control checks whether an Amazon S3 general purpose bucket permits public write access. It evaluates the block public access settings, the bucket policy, and the bucket access control list (ACL). The control fails if the bucket permits public write access.

Some use cases require that everyone on the internet be able to write to your S3 bucket. However, those situations are rare. To ensure the integrity and security of your data, your S3 bucket should not be publicly writable.

This rule is covered by the [s3-bucket-block-public-write-access](https://github.com/hashicorp/policy-library-NIST-Policy-Set-for-AWS-Terraform/blob/main/policies/s3/s3-bucket-block-public-write-access.sentinel) policy.
