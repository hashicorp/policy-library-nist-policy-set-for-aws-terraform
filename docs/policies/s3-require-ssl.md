# Ensure S3 Bucket Policy is set to deny HTTP requests

## Description

DISCLAIMER - This policy works when all resources of type `aws_s3_bucket_policy` are present in the root module and have their `policy` attribute set using `aws_iam_policy_document` datasource.

At the Amazon S3 bucket level, you can configure permissions through a bucket policy making the objects accessible only through HTTPS.

This rule is covered by the [s3-require-ssl](https://github.com/hashicorp/policy-library-NIST-Policy-Set-for-AWS-Terraform/blob/main/policies/s3/s3-require-ssl.sentinel) policy.

## Policy Results (Pass)

      s3-require-ssl.sentinel

      Print messages:
