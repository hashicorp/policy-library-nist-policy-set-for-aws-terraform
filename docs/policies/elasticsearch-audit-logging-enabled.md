## Description

This control checks whether Elasticsearch domains have audit logging enabled. This control fails if an Elasticsearch domain does not have audit logging enabled.

Audit logs are highly customizable. They allow you to track user activity on your Elasticsearch clusters, including authentication successes and failures, requests to OpenSearch, index changes, and incoming search queries.

This rule is covered by the [elasticsearch-audit-logging-enabled](https://github.com/hashicorp/policy-library-NIST-Policy-Set-for-AWS-Terraform/blob/main/policies/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-audit-logging-enabled.sentinel) policy.

## Policy Results (Pass)

```bash
trace:
    Pass - elasticsearch-audit-logging-enabled.sentinel

    Description:
    This policy requires resources of type `aws_elasticsearch_domain` have the
    `log_publishing_options` should have 'enabled' attribute set to `true` and
    'log_type' set to 'AUDIT_LOGS'.

    Print messages:

    → → Overall Result: true

    This result means that all resources have passed the policy check for the policy elasticsearch-audit-logging-enabled.

    ✓ Found 0 resource violations
