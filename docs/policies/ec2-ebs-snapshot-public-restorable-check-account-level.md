## Description

DISCLAIMER - This policy will work only if resources of type `aws_ebs_snapshot_block_public_access` is present and does not check your AWS Account configuration.

This control checks whether Amazon Elastic Block Store snapshots are not public. The control fails if Amazon EBS snapshots are restorable by anyone.

EBS snapshots are used to back up the data on your EBS volumes to Amazon S3 at a specific point in time. You can use the snapshots to restore previous states of EBS volumes. It is rarely acceptable to share a snapshot with the public. Typically the decision to share a snapshot publicly was made in error or without a complete understanding of the implications. This check helps ensure that all such sharing was fully planned and intentional.

This rule is covered by the [ec2-ebs-snapshot-public-restorable-check-account-level](https://github.com/hashicorp/policy-library-NIST-Policy-Set-for-AWS-Terraform/blob/main/policies/ec2/ec2-ebs-snapshot-public-restorable-check-account-level.sentinel) policy.
