# AWS DocumentDB clusters should have backup_retention_period set between '7 to 35'

## Description

This control checks whether an Amazon DocumentDB cluster has a backup retention period greater than or equal to the specified time frame. The control fails if the backup retention period is less than the specified time frame. Unless you provide a custom parameter value for the backup retention period, Security Hub uses a default value of 7 days.

Backups help you recover more quickly from a security incident and strengthen the resilience of your systems. By automating backups for your Amazon DocumentDB clusters, you'll be able to restore your systems to a point in time and minimize downtime and data loss. In Amazon DocumentDB, clusters have a default backup retention period of 1 day. This must be increased to a value between 7 and 35 days to pass this control.

This rule is covered by the [docdb-cluster-backup-retention-check](https://github.com/hashicorp/policy-library-NIST-Policy-Set-for-AWS-Terraform/blob/main/policies/docdb/docdb-cluster-backup-retention-check.sentinel) policy.
