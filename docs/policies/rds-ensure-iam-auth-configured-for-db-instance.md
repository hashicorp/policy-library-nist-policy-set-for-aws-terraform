## Description

This control checks whether an RDS DB instance has IAM database authentication enabled. 
The control fails if IAM authentication is not configured for RDS DB instances. 
This control only evaluates RDS instances with the following engine types: mysql, postgres, aurora, aurora-mysql, aurora-postgresql, and mariadb.

This rule is covered by the [rds-ensure-deletion-protection-enabled](https://github.com/hashicorp/policy-library-NIST-Policy-Set-for-AWS-Terraform/blob/main/policies/rds/rds-ensure-deletion-protection-enabled.sentinel) policy.
Param which needs to be passed is "resource_type" with value - "aws_db_instance"

```bash
trace:

    Pass - rds-ensure-db-instance-iam-auth-configured.sentinel

    Description:
      This policy requires resources of type `aws_db_instance` and `aws_rds_cluster` to have `iam_database_authentication_enabled` set to true

    Print messages:
