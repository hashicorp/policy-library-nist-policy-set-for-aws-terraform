# AWS MQ Broker should have the auto_minor_version_upgrade attribute set to true

## Description

This control checks whether an Amazon MQ broker has automatic minor version upgrade enabled. The control fails if the broker doesn't have automatic minor version upgrade enabled.

As Amazon MQ releases and supports new broker engine versions, the changes are backward-compatible with an existing application and don't deprecate existing functionality. Automatic broker engine version updates protect you against security risks, help fix bugs, and improve functionality.

This rule is covered by the [mq-auto-minor-version-upgrade-enabled](https://github.com/hashicorp/policy-library-NIST-Policy-Set-for-AWS-Terraform/blob/main/policies/mq/mq-auto-minor-version-upgrade-enabled.sentinel) policy.
