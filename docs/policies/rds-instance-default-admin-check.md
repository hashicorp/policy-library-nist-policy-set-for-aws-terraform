## Description

This control checks whether you've changed the administrative username for Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) database instances from the default value. The control does not apply to engines of the type neptune (Neptune DB) or docdb (DocumentDB). The control fails if the administrative username is set to the default value.

Default administrative usernames on Amazon RDS databases are public knowledge. When creating an Amazon RDS database, you should change the default administrative username to a unique value to reduce the risk of unintended access.

This rule is covered by the [rds-instance-default-admin-check](https://github.com/hashicorp/policy-library-NIST-Policy-Set-for-AWS-Terraform/blob/main/policies/rds/rds-instance-default-admin-check.sentinel) policy.
