# AWS RDS cluster should have backtracking enabled

## Description

This control checks whether an Amazon Aurora cluster has backtracking enabled. The control fails if the cluster doesn't have backtracking enabled. If you provide a custom value for the BacktrackWindowInHours parameter, the control passes only if the cluster is backtracked for the specified length of time.

This rule is covered by the [rds-ensure-cluster-backtracking-enabled](https://github.com/hashicorp/policy-library-NIST-Policy-Set-for-AWS-Terraform/blob/main/policies/rds/rds-ensure-cluster-backtracking-enabled.sentinel) policy.

## Policy Results (Pass)
```bash
    Pass - rds-ensure-cluster-backtracking-enabled.sentinel

    Description:
    This policy requires resources of type `aws_rds_cluster` to have
    `backtrack_window` greater than 0 for engine "aurora" and "aurora-mysql"

    Print messages:

    → → Overall Result: true

    This result means that all resources have passed the policy check for the policy rds-ensure-cluster-backtracking-enabled.

    ✓ Found 0 resource violations

    rds-ensure-cluster-backtracking-enabled.sentinel:49:1 - Rule "main"
    Value:
        true
