# Amazon ECS task definitions should have secure networking modes and user definitions

| Provider            | Category     |

| Amazon Web Services | Compute      |

## Description

This policy checks whether an active Amazon ECS task definition with host networking mode has privileged or user container definitions. The policy fails for task definitions that have host network mode and container definitions of privileged=false, empty and user=root, or empty.

This policy only evaluates the latest active revision of an Amazon ECS task definition.

The purpose of this policy is to ensure that access is defined intentionally when you run tasks that use the host network mode. If a task definition has elevated privileges, it is because you have chosen that configuration. This control checks for unexpected privilege escalation when a task definition has host networking enabled, and you don't choose elevated privileges.

This rule is covered by the [ecs-task-definition-secure-networking-mode-and-user-definitions](https://github.com/hashicorp/policy-library-NIST-Policy-Set-for-AWS-Terraform/blob/main/policies/ecs/ecs-task-definition-secure-networking-mode-and-user-definitions.sentinel) policy.
