# IAM policies should not allow full "*" administrative privileges

## Description

DISCLAIMER - This policy works when all resources of type aws_iam_policy and aws_iam_policy_document are present in the root module.

This policy checks whether the default version of IAM policies (also known as customer managed policies) has administrator access by including a statement with "Effect": "Allow" with "Action": "*" over "Resource": "*". The policy fails if you have IAM policy documents with such a statement.

The control only checks the customer managed policies that you create with the `aws_iam_policy_document` datasource. It does not verify the AWS managed/inline policy blocks.

IAM policies define a set of privileges that are granted to users, groups, or roles. Following standard security advice, AWS recommends that you grant least privilege, which means to grant only the permissions that are required to perform a task. When you provide full administrative privileges instead of the minimum set of permissions that the user needs, you expose the resources to potentially unwanted actions.

Instead of allowing full administrative privileges, determine what users need to do and then craft policies that let the users perform only those tasks. It is more secure to start with a minimum set of permissions and grant additional permissions as necessary. Do not start with permissions that are too lenient and then try to tighten them later.

This rule is covered by the [iam-no-admin-privileges-allowed-by-policies](https://github.com/hashicorp/policy-library-NIST-Policy-Set-for-AWS-Terraform/blob/main/policies/iam/iam-no-admin-privileges-allowed-by-policies.sentinel) policy.
