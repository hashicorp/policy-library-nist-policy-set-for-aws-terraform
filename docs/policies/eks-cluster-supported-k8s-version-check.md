# EKS clusters should run on a supported Kubernetes version

## Description

This policy checks whether an Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS cluster) is running on a supported Kubernetes version. The policy fails if the EKS cluster is running on an unsupported version.

If your application doesn't require a specific version of Kubernetes, we recommend that you use the latest available Kubernetes version that's supported by EKS for your clusters.

This rule is covered by the [eks-cluster-supported-k8s-version-check](https://github.com/hashicorp/policy-library-NIST-Policy-Set-for-AWS-Terraform/blob/main/policies/eks/eks-cluster-supported-k8s-version-check.sentinel) policy.

## Policy Results (Pass)

        run on unsupported kubernetes versions

      Print messages:

      This result means that all resources have passed the policy check for the policy eks-cluster-supported-k8s-version-check.
