## Description

This control checks whether direct internet access is disabled for an SageMaker notebook instance. The control fails if the DirectInternetAccess field is enabled for the notebook instance.

If you configure your SageMaker instance without a VPC, then by default direct internet access is enabled on your instance. You should configure your instance with a VPC and change the default setting to Disable—Access the internet through a VPC. To train or host models from a notebook, you need internet access.

This rule is covered by the [sagemaker-notebook-no-direct-internet-access](https://github.com/hashicorp/policy-library-NIST-Policy-Set-for-AWS-Terraform/blob/main/policies/sagemaker/sagemaker-notebook-no-direct-internet-access.sentinel) policy.
