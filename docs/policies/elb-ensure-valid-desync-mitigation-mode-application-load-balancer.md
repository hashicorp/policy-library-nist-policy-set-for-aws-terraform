# Application Load Balancer should be configured with defensive or strictest desync mitigation mode

## Description

This policy checks whether a Application Load Balancer is configured with defensive or strictest desync mitigation mode. The policy fails if the Application Load Balancer isn't configured with defensive or strictest desync mitigation mode.

HTTP Desync issues can lead to request smuggling and make applications vulnerable to request queue or cache poisoning. In turn, these vulnerabilities can lead to credential hijacking or execution of unauthorized commands. Application Load Balancers configured with defensive or strictest desync mitigation mode protect your application from security issues that may be caused by HTTP Desync.

This rule is covered by the [elb-ensure-valid-desync-mitigation-mode](https://github.com/hashicorp/policy-library-NIST-Policy-Set-for-AWS-Terraform/blob/main/policies/elb/elb-ensure-valid-desync-mitigation-mode.sentinel) policy with the `application` as the `lb_type` parameter.
