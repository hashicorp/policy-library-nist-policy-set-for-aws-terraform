# Amazon EC2 subnets should not automatically assign public IP addresses

| Provider            |     Category     |

## Description

This control checks whether the assignment of public IPs in Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) subnets have MapPublicIpOnLaunch set to FALSE. The control passes if the flag is set to FALSE.

All subnets have an attribute that determines whether a network interface created in the subnet automatically receives a public IPv4 address. Instances that are launched into subnets that have this attribute enabled have a public IP address assigned to their primary network interface.

This rule is covered by the [ec2-subnet-with-auto-assign-public-ip-disabled](https://github.com/hashicorp/policy-library-NIST-Policy-Set-for-AWS-Terraform/blob/main/policies/ec2/ec2-subnet-with-auto-assign-public-ip-disabled.sentinel) policy.
