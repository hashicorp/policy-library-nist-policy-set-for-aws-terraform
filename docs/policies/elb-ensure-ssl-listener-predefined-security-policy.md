# Classic Load Balancers with SSL listeners should use a predefined security policy that has strong AWS Configuration

## Description

This policy checks whether your Classic Load Balancer HTTPS/SSL listeners use the predefined policy ELBSecurityPolicy-TLS-1-2-2017-01. The policy fails if the Classic Load Balancer HTTPS/SSL listeners do not use ELBSecurityPolicy-TLS-1-2-2017-01.

A security policy is a combination of SSL protocols, ciphers, and the Server Order Preference option. Predefined policies policy the ciphers, protocols, and preference orders to support during SSL negotiations between a client and load balancer.

This rule is covered by the [elb-ensure-ssl-listener-predefined-security-policy](https://github.com/hashicorp/policy-library-NIST-Policy-Set-for-AWS-Terraform/blob/main/policies/elb/elb-ensure-ssl-listener-predefined-security-policy.sentinel) policy.
