## Description

This control checks whether an Amazon S3 general purpose bucket permits public read access. It evaluates the block public access settings, the bucket policy, and the bucket access control list (ACL). The control fails if the bucket permits public read access.

Some use cases may require that everyone on the internet be able to read from your S3 bucket. However, those situations are rare. To ensure the integrity and security of your data, your S3 bucket should not be publicly readable.

This rule is covered by the [s3-bucket-block-public-read-access](https://github.com/hashicorp/policy-library-NIST-Policy-Set-for-AWS-Terraform/blob/main/policies/s3/s3-bucket-block-public-read-access.sentinel) policy.
