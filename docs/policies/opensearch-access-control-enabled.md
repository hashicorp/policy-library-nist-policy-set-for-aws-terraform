## Description

This control checks whether OpenSearch domains have fine-grained access control enabled. The control fails if the fine-grained access control is not enabled. Fine-grained access control requires advanced-security-optionsin the OpenSearch parameter update-domain-config to be enabled.

Fine-grained access control offers additional ways of controlling access to your data on Amazon OpenSearch Service.

This rule is covered by the [opensearch-access-control-enabled](https://github.com/hashicorp/policy-library-NIST-Policy-Set-for-AWS-Terraform/blob/main/policies/opensearch/opensearch-access-control-enabled.sentinel) policy.
