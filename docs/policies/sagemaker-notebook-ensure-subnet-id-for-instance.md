## Description

This control checks if an Amazon SageMaker notebook instance is launched within a custom virtual private cloud (VPC). This control fails if a SageMaker notebook instance is not launched within a custom VPC or if it is launched in the SageMaker service VPC.

Subnets are a range of IP addresses within a VPC. We recommend keeping your resources inside a custom VPC whenever possible to ensure secure network protection of your infrastructure. An Amazon VPC is a virtual network dedicated to your AWS account. With an Amazon VPC, you can control the network access and internet connectivity of your SageMaker Studio and notebook instances.

This rule is covered by the [sagemaker-notebook-ensure-subnet-id-for-instance](https://github.com/hashicorp/policy-library-NIST-Policy-Set-for-AWS-Terraform/blob/main/policies/sagemaker/sagemaker-notebook-ensure-subnet-id-for-instance.sentinel) policy.
