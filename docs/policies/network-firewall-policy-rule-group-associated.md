## Description

This control checks whether a Network Firewall policy has any stateful or stateless rule groups associated. The control fails if stateless or stateful rule groups are not assigned.

This rule is covered by the [network-firewall-policy-rule-group-associated](https://github.com/hashicorp/policy-library-NIST-Policy-Set-for-AWS-Terraform/blob/main/policies/network-firewall/network-firewall-policy-rule-group-associated.sentinel) policy.

## Policy Results (Pass)
