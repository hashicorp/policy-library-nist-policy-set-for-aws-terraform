## Description

This control checks whether a Neptune DB cluster has automated backups enabled, and a backup retention period greater than or equal to the specified time frame. By default the timeframe is set as 7 days and is configrable via the the `backup_retention_period` param.

This rule is covered by the [neptune-cluster-automated-backups-enabled](https://github.com/hashicorp/policy-library-NIST-Policy-Set-for-AWS-Terraform/blob/main/policies/neptune/neptune-cluster-automated-backups-enabled.sentinel) policy.

## Policy Results (Pass)
```bash
trace:
    Pass - neptune-cluster-automated-backups-enabled.sentinel

    Description:
    This policy requires attribute 'backup_retention_period' to be greater than or
    equal to 7 for 'aws_neptune_cluster' resources

    Print messages:

    → → Overall Result: true

    This result means that all resources have passed the policy check for the policy neptune-cluster-automated-backups-enabled.

    ✓ Found 0 resource violations

    neptune-cluster-automated-backups-enabled.sentinel:51:1 - Rule "main"
    Value:
        true
