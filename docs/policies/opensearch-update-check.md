# AWS OpenSearch domains should have the latest software update installed

## Description

This control checks whether an Amazon OpenSearch Service domain has the latest software update installed. The control fails if a software update is available but not installed for the domain.

OpenSearch Service software updates provide the latest platform fixes, updates, and features available for the environment. Keeping up-to-date with patch installation helps maintain domain security and availability. If no action is taken on required updates, the service software is updated automatically (typically after 2 weeks). We recommend scheduling updates during a time of low traffic to the domain to minimize service disruption.

This rule is covered by the [opensearch-update-check](https://github.com/hashicorp/policy-library-NIST-Policy-Set-for-AWS-Terraform/blob/main/policies/opensearch/opensearch-update-check.sentinel) policy.
