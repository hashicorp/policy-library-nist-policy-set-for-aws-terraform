## Description

This control checks whether an Amazon Redshift cluster has changed the admin username from its default value. This control will fail if the admin username for a Redshift cluster is set to awsuser.

When creating a Redshift cluster, you should change the default admin username to a unique value. Default usernames are public knowledge and should be changed upon configuration. Changing the default usernames reduces the risk of unintended access.

This rule is covered by the [redshift-cluster-default-admin-check](https://github.com/hashicorp/policy-library-NIST-Policy-Set-for-AWS-Terraform/blob/main/policies/redshift/redshift-cluster-default-admin-check.sentinel) policy.

## Policy Results (Pass)

```bash
trace:
      Pass - redshift-cluster-default-admin-check.sentinel

      Description:
        This policy checks if resources of type 'aws_redshift_cluster' have the
        'master_username'
        attribute not set to null or 'awsuser' (default value)

      Print messages:

      → → Overall Result: true

      This result means that all resources have passed the policy check for the policy redshift-cluster-default-admin-check.

      ✓ Found 0 resource violations

      redshift-cluster-default-admin-check.sentinel:48:1 - Rule "main"
        Value:
