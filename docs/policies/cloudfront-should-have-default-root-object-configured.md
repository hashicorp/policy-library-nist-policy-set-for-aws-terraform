# CloudFront distributions should have a default root object configured

## Description

This control checks whether an Amazon CloudFront distribution is configured to return a specific object that is the default root object. The control fails if the CloudFront distribution does not have a default root object configured.

A user might sometimes request the distribution's root URL instead of an object in the distribution. When this happens, specifying a default root object can help you to avoid exposing the contents of your web distribution.

This rule is covered by the [cloudfront-should-have-default-root-object-configured](https://github.com/hashicorp/policy-library-NIST-Policy-Set-for-AWS-Terraform/blob/main/policies/cloudfront/cloudfront-should-have-default-root-object-configured.sentinel) policy.
